PowerShell Quick Wins by Maxime Fortier
--------------------------

Quick Wins by Maxime Fortier where design and developed with the following objectives in mind: 
- Provide quality tools that are more than easy to use. 
- Make them freely available to everyone
- Share the code so anyone can adapt them to fit their needs. 

The Quick Wins Project has been built by myself during my spare time. It is your responsibility to adapt those pieces of code to make them fit in your organization. 

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

I was tired of looking online for some free checksum tools. To be truly honest, I do not trust any of them. I thought it would be easier to build one. Performance is not too bad either.
